 I watch a lot of anime and a live in my IDE. Currently exploring flutter and it's endless canvas possibilities. I'm a full-stack engineer, I'm in love minimalism and good designs.



Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a mobile payment system
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning flutter for cross-platform development
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on multiple projects to help build my skills
